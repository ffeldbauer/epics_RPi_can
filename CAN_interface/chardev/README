This is the (old) chardev version of the kernel module for the
PANDA Raspberry Pi CANbus Extension Board.

`make` will build the kernel module, support library and test program.

The kernel module is heavily based on the kernel module
from Peak Systems (http://www.peak-system.com/),
also published under the GNU General Public License.
