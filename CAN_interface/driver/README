=========

This is the kernel module of the CAN bus interface
for the Raspberry Pi Computer developed by the PANDA
Collaboration.

The kernel module is heavily based on the kernel module
from Peak Systems, also published under the GNU General Public License.

The kernel module is for revision 2 of the Raspberry Pi Computer.
If you are using revision 1, you have to change the used GPIOs and
corresponding masks in can_gpio.c ( GPIO27 was GPIO21 on rev1)
