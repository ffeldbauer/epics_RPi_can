=========

This is the kernel module of the CAN bus interface
for the Raspberry Pi Computer developed by the PANDA
Collaboration.

One of the used GPIOs has changed from revision 1 to revision 2
of the Raspberry Pi Computer ( GPIO 21 <-> GPIO 27 ).
By default the driver assumes revision 2. If the driver
should be compiled for revision 1 use compiler flag "-DREV1"
