This package is used by the PANDA collaboration for EPICS device support.
The following devices controlled via CAN bus interfaces are supported:
 - CAN interface (as lower-level driver used by all other drivers)
 - ISEG EHS/EDS high voltage modules (http://www.iseg-hv.com/en/products/product-details/product/21/)
 - Wiener VME crate remote control (via CAN, http://www.wiener-d.com/products/24/19.html)
 - Temperature and Humidity Monitoring board for PANDA (THMP)
 - PANDA-EMC light pulser
 - TMCM142 1-axis stepper controller/driver (via CAN, http://www.mocontronic.de/de/katalog/motorsteuerungen/TMCM-142-IF)

As CAN interfaces currently interfaces from PEAK System (http://www.peak-system.com)
and an adaptor board for the Raspberry Pi Computer developed by the PANDA collaboration
are supported.
