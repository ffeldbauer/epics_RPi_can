=========

This package is used by the PANDA collaboration for EPICS device support
for all devices which are controlled via CAN bus interfaces.
This device support is realised using AsynPortDrivers:
- CAN interface (as lower-level driver used by all other drivers)
- ISEG EHS/EDS high voltage modules (http://www.iseg-hv.com/en/products/product-details/product/21/)
- Wiener VME crate remote control (via CAN, http://www.wiener-d.com/products/24/19.html)
- Temperature and Humidity Monitoring board for PANDA (THMP)
- PANDA-EMC light pulser
- TMCM142 1-axis stepper controller/driver (via CAN, http://www.mocontronic.de/de/katalog/motorsteuerungen/TMCM-142-IF)

As CAN interfaces currently interfaces from PEAK System (http://www.peak-system.com)
and an adaptor board for the Raspberry Pi Computer developed by the PANDA collaboration
are supported. The drvAsynCan device support module will need the peak system driver (or
for linux-arm the included CAN driver for the adaptor board) to compile.
See drvAsynCan.html for details on the AsynPortDrivers.

Refer to LICENSE for details on the software license agreement
of EPICS

To use the AsynPortDrivers you will need
- EPICS base 3.14.12.2 or later (http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/)
- AsynDriver 4-21 or later (http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/)
