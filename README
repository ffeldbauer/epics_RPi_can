This package contains schematics and driver for a CAN Bus interface for
the Raspberry Pi Computer (http://www.raspberrypi.org).
The driver is based on the PEAK-Systems Linux driver 7.6 published under
the GNU General Public License.

AsynPortDrivers for the EPICS control system framework are also included.
Currently these AsynPortDrivers support
- the CAN interface (as lower-level driver used by all other drivers)
- ISEG EHS/EDS high voltage modules
- Wiener VME crate remote control
- Temperature and Humidity Monitoring board for PANDA (THMP)
- PANDA-EMC light pulser

To use the AsynPortDrivers you will need
- EPICS base (http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/)
- SNL Sequncer (http://www-csr.bessy.de/control/SoftDist/sequencer/)
- AsynDriver (http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/)
